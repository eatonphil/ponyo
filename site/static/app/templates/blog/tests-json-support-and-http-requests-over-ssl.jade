                    It's been a while since I last posted an update on Ponyo and
                    I've got some really exciting features to announce. In the past
                    few months, we've added a simple testing framework and begun
                    writing tests. We've added a JSON parsing and marshalling functions
                    to help transform JSON strings into Standard ML records. And in the
                    last week, I added rudimentary support for active SSL sockets by
                    hooking into OpenSSL.
                p.
                    The test framework simply collects lists of boolean values and
                    indicates where one is false. These tests can contain other
                    groups of tests that are collected and reported back as a boolean.
                    See the <a href="https://github.com/eatonphil/ponyo/blob/master/test/Ponyo_String_Test.sml">String</a>
                    test module for an example. Using this method I found and fixed
                    a number of bugs in the String module. The Ponyo repo is now hooked
                    up to <a href="https://travis-ci.org/eatonphil/ponyo">Travis CI</a> so pull requests
                    can begin to be tested automatically before being merged.
                p.
                    Right now, the test modules must be collected
                    <a href="https://github.com/eatonphil/ponyo/blob/master/test/build.sml">manually</a>.
                    The goal is to replace this with a test runner that calls a
                    function in every .sml file in a directory.
                p.
                    With the addition of JSON parsing and HTTP clients talking over
                    SSL, you can finally begin one of the things I've been most excited
                    for: consuming real APIs. Check out this <a href="https://gist.github.com/eatonphil/ba660a7594dec2fb601a1cb1ac0208eb">example</a>
                    that uses these recent additions to parse and print out a list
                    of Linode datacenters.
                p.
                    Disclaimer: even though this stuff is functional, it's just barely so.
                    Don't use this for anything serious.
