                    It's been a little more than a month since ponyo.org first
                    came online. Less has happened than I would have liked, but
                    I just started a new job and things have begun to settle
                    again. However, significantly more than nothing has happened
                    and there is some news to report.
                p.
                    Since the last post, documentation generation has taken a
                    serious step forward. You can begin to see documentation
                    generated and hosted here already. While the foundation has
                    begun to be made, there is still a large amount that the
                    Ponyo Standard ML parser cannot parse. So certain structures
                    cannot be documented until they can be fully parsed.
                p.
                    I've also begun to work on a testing framework for Ponyo.
                    This is one of my highest priorities, but is not completely
                    straightforward.
                p.
                    But the most exciting news to announce is the beginnings
                    of the Ponyo handbook. My goal with the handbook is to
                    collect a number of "tracks" of learning relevant for those
                    interested in Ponyo. Today, I announce the first article in
                    the Standard ML Basics track. I plan to follow up shortly
                    with the first article in the Ponyo Basics track. If you are
                    interested in contributing to the handbook or see mistakes
                    or areas in need of improvement, please remember this is a
                    community document and can be improved by the community via
                    the Github pull request and issues interfaces.

                    That's it for now. Happy compiling folks!
